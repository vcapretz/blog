I've been posting on Medium and also on Dev.to and the time has come for me to host my own blog now.

In the process of figuring out the layout I stumbled on [Rauch's blog](https://rauchg.com/) and decided to clone his repository and iterate on my own over time.

I didn't want to use the same square SVG as his so I decided to play with some animations and make something myself.

The final animation should:

<ol style={{ listStyle: "decimal outside" }}>
  <li>Be accessible;</li>
  <li>
    Not use JS. So users can still experience it if they decide to disable JS
    for the page.
  </li>
</ol>

For the point **_#1_** my idea has to keep the HTML markup simple, having less problems by default with screen readers.
Point **_#2_** quickly removes a lot of options and tutorials you find on Google.

<h2 id="goal">The goal</h2>

Here's a GIF with my desired outcome, I wanted to play with my full name (Vitor Capretz) and the username I use everywhere online (including this blog's domain), which is **vcapretz** only.

To guide users into making the connection with my name I thought I could fade out the **_itor_** part and then slide the rest together:

<Image
  src="/images/animate-css-text/blog_animation.gif"
  width={576}
  height={112}
  alt="Text animation from vitorcapretz.com to vcapretz.com by fading and moving part of the text"
/>

<h2 id="code">The code</h2>

To make sure the code would still be accessible (and avoid hurting SEO at the same time) I wanted to keep into one element only, the HTML markup ends up being fairly simple:

```html
<div>
  <span>vitorcapretz.com</span>
</div>
```

The div is there as a wrapper for styling purposes (encapsulate the `span` tag in a smaller scope).
The actual text interpreted in the HTML markup and also by screen readers will be the most descriptive one, with my full name.

To get the desired effect I considered the animation having 3 "parts": the letter **_v_** would stay in place, the **_capretz.com_** is what slides and the letters in between fade out.

Achieving that without JavaScript (you can for instance select each letter and play with them) proved more difficulty than I thought, so I used the `::before` and `::after` selectors in css. They allow you changing the rendered page without adding new explict tags to it.

```css
span {
  padding: 10px;

  animation: animate-main 1s ease-in-out 2s forwards;
}

span:before {
  content: "v";
  position: absolute;
  color: black;
}

span:after {
  content: "capretz.com";

  position: absolute;
  right: 10px; // add 10 because of the padding applied to the actual span

  color: black;

  animation: animate-after 1s ease-in-out 3s forwards;
}
```

With this part added I got a new _v_ letter and _capretz.com_ placed in front of the original ones (using absolute positioning), so we can use the `animate-main` animation to fade-out.

The thing with css animations is that you cannot apply it to every property, it (usually) has to be something linear, like a number going up or down between animation frames.

I tried using `opacity` and quickly realized that because it is applied to the parent `span` tag it will hide everything, no good.

I figured I could try animating colors instead, if the main text goes from `black` to `white` we can achieve the visual effect of them not being visible anymore, the declaration looks like:

```css
@keyframes animate-main {
  0% {
    color: black;
  }

  100% {
    color: white;
  }
}
```

> `black` and `white` are HEX values in the end, thus being iterable.

Now we need to move the _capretz.com_ text to the side, touching the remaining _v_ letter, which can be done by translating the element:

```css
@keyframes animate-after {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  100% {
    transform: translateX(-27%);
  }
}
```

I tweaked with the translation values and magically came up with the _27%_, this is likely not a reliable solution (say I change the text, I would need to tweak the values again).

Both animations have a `delay` value (set right next to the timing function, which is `ease-in-out` in this case), as I wanted the first part to start only after a few seconds the page has been rendered, the second part has to wait for the first one to be complete.

If you want to check out the full code, feel free to head to the [logo component GitHub link](https://github.com/vcapretz/blog/blob/main/components/logo.tsx)!

When testing the code I noticed I was applying some stlying to the its background on `:hover` state, which then made the letters somewhat visible. I then learned you can also use `color: transparent` in the animation, which solved the hover problem.

If you have any feedback or suggestions to my solution (or to the blog post) please [send a DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/vcapretz) and I'll be glad to hear from you!

My code is not perfect and the same result can likely be achieved in many ways.

Thank you for you time, have a great day ðŸ˜ƒ
